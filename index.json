We started that vision by selling eggs on retail (store). Our company grew slowly but surely. After our long hiatus, we comeback with a new built mill and restaurant. While preparing for the opening of our restaurant business, we tried selling flour and milk on the market (exchange). It was so successful that we stop selling eggs, and focus on producing more flour and milk. That leads to us on postponing our plans on opening the restaurant.\nAfter a lot of studies in encyclopedia with our Chief Financial Officer at that time, Marcus Sandberg, we we decided to do a flour business. Because of that, HMCo. built more plantations and mills to produce more flour.\nIt may seem that we are close to our vision when we built the restaurant, but it\u0026rsquo;s not. Actually, Hidden Manna Company risk for a restaurant business but we cannot still afford it. We can make lots of profit on selling flour than opening the restaurant and sell bread. We risked everything but lost in the end. We survived that lost because of our flour business. After that, we invested on improving the quality of our products and upgrading our buildings.\nWe, at Hidden Manna Co., make our products using our own made raw materials. We sell them out on market as soon as it gets to our warehouse so our buyers can be sure that it\u0026rsquo;s all fresh, high-quality and low-cost.

(HMC/HMCo.) is a corporation owned by Drew Kudo, their Chief Executive Officer, and managed by her executives.\nHidden Manna Co. got their name from the Bible where \u0026lsquo;hidden manna\u0026rsquo; refers to bread as the company first wants to sell bread and its ingredients. HMC started in October 2022 at producing eggs from their farm and selling them in retail. Next, they decided to be independent from their water and power supply needs of their plantations and farms so they\u0026rsquo;ve built their own power plant and water reservoir. In December on the same year, HMC stopped their company\u0026rsquo;s operations because of some internal issues.\nAfter a long hiatus, Hidden Manna Co. started their operations again in May 2023, and built a mill and a restaurant. While preparing for the opening of their restaurant business, they started selling flour and milk on the market first. It was so successful that they decided to stop selling eggs on retail, and also stop their plan on opening a restaurant to sell breads. Instead, they focus on producing flour and on selling them on market after a lot of studies in encyclopedia with their Chief Financial Officer at that time, Marcus Sandberg. Because of that, HMC built more plantations and mills to produce more flour.\nNow, Hidden Manna Co. also invested on research and development of their products/ingredients: water, power, seeds, grains, and flour through the help of their now Chief Technical Officer, Mr. Sandberg. HMC will do more in the future now that they have their new Chief Financial Officer, Katie Leslie.\nExecutive(s) # Current # CEO: Drew Kudo COO: X AE A-12 Thunberg CFO: N/A CMO: N/A CTO: Ben Fourcade Retired # CFO: Katie Leslie CTO: Marcus Sandberg Important date(s) # 08/16/23 – CV: $1,157,378 09/08/23 – CV: $2,236,721 09/20/23 – Corporation ","date":"12 July 2023","permalink":"/about/","section":"Hidden Manna Co.","summary":"Information # Type: Corporation Founded by Drew Kudo Established on 19 Oct 2022 Registered in Vanuatu About us # Hidden Manna Co.
